22. When i call the getName method it gives me the name for the object (the name i put at the start) 

24. When i call the number of students it says that there is 0 students

31. 0 = int
   “hello” = string
   101 = int
    -1 = int
   true = boolean
   “33” = string
   3.1415 double

32. you would have to make a new class to add a new field

33. public void send (String message)

34. public int average (int number1, int number2)

35. The book i am reading is the first with java and it would be an object with Book being its class

36. I dont think an object can have multiple classes because its supposed to be for the class it was created from.
   if it could have been under multiple classes then it would defeat the purpose of the class. I think its only meant to be 
   under one class because it is created from one class.
